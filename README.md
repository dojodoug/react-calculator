# React Calculator

This exercise focuses on creating a prototype for a calculator based on two predetermined mockups. The main purpose of the project was to replicate the styling for the calculator as the implementation for the calculation logic was optional. 

## Requirements

Implement the front end code and event handlers such that it can be hooked into a calculation processor.\
The calculator buttons should respond to user interactions.\
The calculator should be theme-able based on the predetermined mockups and colors that were provided.\
The calculator works well different viewport sizes.

## Execution

The calculator was built using React. I decided to use React because I have been eager to work on a small project to gain more experience using React and this was a perfect opportunity to do so. To get started I chose to use [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started) so that I could take advantage of the build setup and then quickly focus on the front code. And though the calculation logic was optional I wanted to try and implement some of the basic functionality. To do this I utilized the [mathjs](https://mathjs.org/) library via npm to tackle the calcultor calculations.

## Current Status and To Dos

The styling for the calculator has been completed, as well as, the ability to switch between to the two themes. The user is also able to interact with all of the buttons and the event handlers are in place. However, when I have more time to work on this project there are a few issues that I discovered that need some additional work. A few of the event handlers and the calculation logic needs to be fine tuned and/or expanded upon to eliminate issues related to using the operators and processing the calculations.
